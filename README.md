# intern application from Jung Chan

First thing, I highly doubt this code will work. I have not tested it.
I'm currently busy studying for exams, so I don't really have time to setup golang correctly on the computer

It would probably be much quicker for you to just look through the code in main.go(its not long)

I have tried to write the progam in go to the best of my abilities, using some resources from the internet

thank you for taking the time to glance through my code
